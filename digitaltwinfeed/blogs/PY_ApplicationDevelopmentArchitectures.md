## Introduction
When developing python applications, there are a host of programs (IDEs, frameworks etc.) that can be used for developement

A broad category of typical development projects are:
Calculations with simple output displayed as text or chart. Only python backend programming
Python backend using Jupyter Notebook


We will address the following in this article.

## Backend Python

If you have written multiple python programs, it is highly possible that previously written python applications are not running.
To get the non-running programs to run, one has to update certain pacakges or update the code. This is not practical at all for sustainable programming

To the rescue are virtual envrionments. pipenv and conda can be used for creating environments. See Conda for Non-programmer,
[All About Conda Environments](/blog/allAboutConda.html)
It is recommended to have a dedicated virtual envronment for each program so updating one project will not influence or break the other programs.

If Anaconda is used, utilize miniconda when compared to Anaconda for smaller footprint.
The smaller footprint and smaller number of libraries installed in base envronment will help upgrading and maintaining conda easy

Pip vs. Conda is a unabated debate. See a brief comparison in [New article](New article)

## Simple Report and Charts
Python Backend - Utilize Matplotlib (or) other popular libraries
Python Frontend (Simple) - Jupyter Notebooks. Notebooks can also be shared to other team members via a mapping. Network security in some organizations can stymie this sharing.
