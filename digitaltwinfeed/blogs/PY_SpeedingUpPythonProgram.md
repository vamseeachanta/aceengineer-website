## Introduction
Typical python programs run pretty quick. However as data burden grows, the analysis time increases and the entire ecosystem comes under scrutinity.

The code is reviewed for bottlenecks.

Some of the practical experiences are discussed below.1

## Python calculations

The data frames, data types, manipulating them are sometimes
The native python data types (Dictionaries, Arrays etc.) are typically fast. However, with more data (> 100,000 rows),
dataframes take more processing to perform calculations. Performing calculations dependent on previous row can also be painstakingly slow.

To speed up the process a few ideas are discussed below:
cython. Cython package is used for
Python if using native python datatypes (arrays, )
