### Pain Points

1. **Weather Window Analysis**
   - Vessel operability requires 100+ sea states
   - Missing weather window = $500K/day
   - Manual analysis too slow for operations

2. **Installation Pre-Engineering**
   - Lift analysis for multiple equipment pieces
   - Motion allowables for offshore transfers
   - Last-minute scope changes need fast turnaround

3. **Contractor Deliverable Review**
   - Checking sub-contractor analysis packages
   - Ensuring standards compliance
   - Tight review timelines

### Our Solution

| Their Problem | Our Automation |
|---------------|----------------|
| Weather window analysis | Real-time operability tool |
