        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <br>
        <p><b>What are the various project types performed?</b></p>
        <p>The various project types performed to date are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Engineering analysis.</li>
            <li>Engineering software simulations.</li>
            <li>Physics-based animations.</li>
            <li>Data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>What are the typical client engagements?</b></p>
        <p>The typical client engagements are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Existing open-source libraries are available for general use: Free</li>
            <li>New project with no existing library: Time and material basis</li>
            <li>Customization of an existing open-source library: Time and material basis</li>
            <li>New and cutting-edge libraries can be developed at a low cost, contingent on resource availability.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Are algorithm libraries delivered as private property or open-source?</b></p>
        <p>Data is completely abstracted from the algorithm, and the algorithm is released with assumed data.
        If the algorithm contains client intellectual property (IP), it will be delivered via a private repository.
        Where practical and not constrained by IP, algorithms are released as open-source libraries for general use.</p>

        <p><b>What are the algorithm best practices?</b></p>
        <p>The algorithms are prepared for real-world use. Best practices followed include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" target="_blank">Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles</a>.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.pentalog.com/blog/it-development-technology/solid-principles-object-oriented-programming/" target="_blank">SOLID programming principles</a>, with a demo on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design" target="_blank">SOLID design using a calculator</a>.</li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">Test-Driven Development (TDD)</a>.</li>
            <li>Unit tests and behavior tests.</li>
            <li>End-to-end behavior tests to cover critical edge cases.</li>
