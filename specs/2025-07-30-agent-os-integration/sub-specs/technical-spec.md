# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-agent-os-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-30
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Agent OS Documentation Structure**: Create `.agent-os/product/` directory with mission.md, tech-stack.md, roadmap.md, and decisions.md files reflecting actual codebase analysis
- **Database Security Migration**: Replace string concatenation SQL queries in database.py with parameterized queries or SQLAlchemy ORM to eliminate injection vulnerabilities
- **Template Organization**: Move main application HTML files from root directory to `templates/` folder following Flask best practices and DTF patterns
- **Authentication Standardization**: Implement secure password hashing with proper salting to replace current SHA256-only approach
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Create comprehensive test suite for main application matching DTF's pytest structure and coverage standards
- **Configuration Management**: Secure environment variable handling for sensitive data like email credentials currently hardcoded in config.py

## Approach Options

**Option A: Gradual Migration Approach**
- Pros: Preserves functionality during transition, allows testing at each step, minimal deployment risk
- Cons: Longer implementation timeline, temporary code duplication during migration

**Option B: Complete Restructure Approach** (Selected)
- Pros: Clean final architecture, eliminates technical debt immediately, unified patterns from start
- Cons: Higher initial complexity, requires comprehensive testing before deployment

**Rationale:** Option B is selected because the current security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, weak password hashing) require immediate attention, and the template organization issues prevent proper Flask development patterns. A comprehensive approach ensures consistency across both applications and eliminates the need for future refactoring.

## External Dependencies

- **Flask-SQLAlchemy** - Database ORM for secure query handling and unified database patterns
- **Justification:** Required to eliminate SQL injection vulnerabilities and standardize database access patterns across main app and DTF platform

- **bcrypt or werkzeug.security** - Secure password hashing
- **Justification:** Current SHA256 without salt is cryptographically weak; need industry-standard password hashing

- **pytest-flask** - Flask-specific testing utilities for main application
- **Justification:** DTF already uses pytest; need Flask extensions for comprehensive main app testing coverage

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Agent OS Foundation
1. Analyze existing codebase thoroughly to understand current state
2. Create Agent OS product documentation reflecting actual implementation
3. Establish development standards based on current DTF patterns

### Phase 2: Security and Database
1. Implement secure database layer with parameterized queries/ORM
2. Update authentication system with proper password hashing
3. Secure configuration management for sensitive data

### Phase 3: Structure and Testing
1. Reorganize template structure following Flask best practices
2. Implement comprehensive testing for main application
3. Validate all existing functionality preserved

### Phase 4: Documentation and Workflow
1. Complete Agent OS integration with spec-driven development
2. Document all architectural decisions and migration steps
3. Establish ongoing development workflow using Agent OS patterns
