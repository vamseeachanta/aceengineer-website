## Test Coverage Plan

### Unit Tests

**Models Tests (New SQLAlchemy Models)**
- User model password hashing and verification
- User model validation and constraints
- Note model creation and relationships
- Image model metadata and file path validation
- Database schema integrity and foreign key constraints

**Database Layer Tests**
- ORM query functionality replacing string concatenation
- Transaction handling and rollback scenarios
- Data migration integrity from SQLite to PostgreSQL
- Connection pooling and concurrent access patterns

**Security Tests**
- Password hashing strength validation (bcrypt vs SHA256)
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Authentication flow security improvements
- File upload security and path validation

### Integration Tests

**Main Application Routes**
- Homepage and static pages rendering with new template structure
- User authentication flow with improved security
- Private dashboard functionality with new database layer
- Admin panel operations with proper authorization
- Contact form submission and email integration

**Template Rendering**
- Template organization in proper templates/ directory structure
- Static asset loading with consolidated asset management
- Cross-application consistency between main app and DTF templates
- Responsive design preservation across template migration

**Database Integration**
- User registration and login with new authentication system
- Notes CRUD operations through SQLAlchemy ORM
- Image upload and management with new database schema
- Data integrity across user sessions and concurrent access

### Feature Tests

**End-to-End User Workflows**
- Complete user registration → login → dashboard → notes management flow
- Admin user management and oversight capabilities
- File upload → storage → retrieval → display workflow
- Contact form submission → email delivery → admin notification flow

**Cross-Application Integration**
- Navigation between main consultancy site and DTF platform
- Shared authentication if applicable between applications
- Consistent styling and user experience across both applications

**Security Validation**
- Attempt SQL injection attacks against new ORM layer (should fail)
- Password strength validation and secure storage verification
- File upload security boundary testing
- Session management and CSRF protection validation

### Mocking Requirements

**Email Services**
- Mock Flask-Mail SMTP connections for contact form testing
- Test email template rendering and content validation
- Simulate email delivery failures and error handling

**File System Operations**
- Mock file upload operations for consistent test environments
- Test file path validation and security restrictions
- Simulate disk space limitations and upload failures

**Database Connections**
- Mock PostgreSQL connection for unit tests using SQLite in-memory
- Test database migration scenarios with controlled data sets
- Simulate connection failures and retry mechanisms

**External Dependencies**
- Mock Heroku environment detection for configuration testing
- Test SSL enforcement logic in different deployment scenarios

## Testing Infrastructure

### Pytest Configuration
```python
# conftest.py - Main application testing setup
import pytest
from app import create_app
from models import db, User, Note, Image
import tempfile
import os

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    """Create application for testing."""
    app = create_app('testing')
    with app.app_context():
        db.create_all()
        yield app
        db.drop_all()

@pytest.fixture
def client(app):
    """Create test client."""
    return app.test_client()

@pytest.fixture
def runner(app):
    """Create test CLI runner."""
    return app.test_cli_runner()

@pytest.fixture
def auth_user(app):
    """Create authenticated user for testing."""
    with app.app_context():
        user = User(username='testuser', email='test@example.com')
        user.set_password('testpass123')
        db.session.add(user)
        db.session.commit()
        return user
```

```

### Test Execution Strategy

**Development Testing**
- Run comprehensive test suite before any commit
- Automated test execution on file changes during development
- Parallel test execution to minimize feedback time

**Continuous Integration**
- Automated testing on push to main/staging branches
- Test both SQLite (development) and PostgreSQL (production) configurations
- Security vulnerability scanning as part of test pipeline

**Performance Testing**
- Database query performance comparison (SQLite vs PostgreSQL)
- Template rendering performance after reorganization
- File upload handling under load scenarios

## Success Criteria

**Test Coverage Targets**
- 90%+ code coverage for new SQLAlchemy models and database layer
- 100% coverage for security-related functions (authentication, password handling)
- Comprehensive integration test coverage for all user-facing functionality

**Security Validation**
- Zero SQL injection vulnerabilities in automated security scans
- Password security validation against OWASP guidelines
- File upload security boundary enforcement validation

**Regression Prevention**
- All existing functionality preserved and validated through tests
- Performance benchmarks maintained or improved after migration
- Cross-browser compatibility maintained for template changes
