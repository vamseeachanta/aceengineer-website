        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p>Analytical & Computational Engineering (<b>A&CE</b>) was established in 2010 to provide data-driven engineering services.</p>
        <p><b>A&CE</b> solves technical problems as algorithm or library solutions driven by abstracted data.
            <b>A&CE</b> helps drive futuristic algorithm solutions to help utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence for engineering systems.
            These algorithm solutions running in compute engines can be utilized by
            state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems to drive insights and further automate engineering systems.</p>
        <p>The typical use cases are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reusable engineering algorithms.</li>
            <li>Algorithms/library delivered as a service.</li>
            <li>Compute engine algorithms as web services.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
