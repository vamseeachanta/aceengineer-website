            <!-- Abstract -->
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Abstract:</strong> Traditional fatigue life prediction relies on S-N curves derived from limited experimental data, often leading to overly conservative designs or unexpected failures. This article explores how machine learning approaches can capture complex material behavior, environmental effects, and loading history—delivering more accurate predictions while maintaining the safety margins required for critical infrastructure.
            </div>

            <!-- Introduction -->
            <section>
                <h2>The Fatigue Challenge in Engineering</h2>
                <p>Fatigue failure remains one of the most common and dangerous failure modes in engineering structures. From offshore platforms to aircraft components, cyclic loading gradually damages materials until catastrophic failure occurs—often with little warning.</p>

                <p>The traditional approach to fatigue assessment relies on S-N curves (stress-life curves) developed from laboratory testing. While these curves have served the industry for decades, they have significant limitations:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Limited data:</strong> S-N curves are typically derived from small sample sizes under idealized conditions</li>
                    <li><strong>Single-variable focus:</strong> Traditional curves don't capture interactions between stress, temperature, corrosion, and loading frequency</li>
                    <li><strong>Conservative factors:</strong> Uncertainty leads to large safety factors, resulting in heavier, more expensive designs</li>
                    <li><strong>Poor extrapolation:</strong> Predictions outside the tested range are unreliable</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Machine learning offers a fundamentally different approach: instead of fitting simplified curves to limited data, ML models can learn complex patterns from comprehensive datasets—including operational data from real structures.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Traditional Methods -->
            <section>
                <h2>How Traditional Fatigue Assessment Works</h2>

                <h3>The S-N Curve Approach</h3>
                <p>The standard S-N curve relates stress amplitude (S) to the number of cycles to failure (N). The relationship typically follows Basquin's equation:</p>

                <div class="code-example">
                    S = A × N^b

                    Where:
                    S = Stress amplitude (MPa)
                    N = Number of cycles to failure
                    A = Fatigue strength coefficient
                    b = Fatigue strength exponent (typically -0.05 to -0.15)
                </div>

                <h3>Design Code Implementation</h3>
                <p>Industry standards like DNV-RP-C203 and API RP 2A provide S-N curves for different material categories and environments. Engineers select the appropriate curve and apply safety factors based on:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Consequence of failure (safety critical vs. non-critical)</li>
                    <li>Inspection accessibility</li>
                    <li>Design fatigue factor (DFF) typically 2-10</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>The Problem:</strong> These safety factors are applied uniformly, regardless of how well the specific conditions match the S-N curve's test conditions. A joint operating in benign conditions gets the same penalty as one in severe service.
                </div>

                <h3>Miner's Rule for Damage Accumulation</h3>
                <p>For variable amplitude loading, fatigue damage is typically calculated using Miner's cumulative damage rule:</p>

                <div class="code-example">
                    D = Σ (n_i / N_i)

                    Where:
                    D = Cumulative damage (failure at D = 1.0)
                    n_i = Number of cycles at stress level i
                    N_i = Cycles to failure at stress level i (from S-N curve)
                </div>

                <p>While simple and widely used, Miner's rule assumes damage accumulation is linear and sequence-independent—both assumptions that contradict experimental evidence.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- ML Approach -->
            <section>
                <h2>The Machine Learning Approach</h2>

                <p>Machine learning transforms fatigue prediction from curve-fitting to pattern recognition. Instead of assuming a mathematical relationship, ML models discover the underlying patterns from data.</p>

                <h3>Key Advantages of ML for Fatigue</h3>

                </table>

                <h3>ML Model Architectures for Fatigue</h3>

                <h4>1. Gradient Boosting for Tabular Data</h4>
                <p>For structured fatigue data with multiple features, gradient boosting methods (XGBoost, LightGBM) excel at capturing non-linear relationships:</p>

                <div class="code-example">
# Example: XGBoost for fatigue life prediction
import xgboost as xgb
import numpy as np

# Features: [stress_amp, mean_stress, temperature, frequency,
#            R_ratio, surface_roughness, environment_code]
X_train = np.array([...])  # Training features
y_train = np.array([...])  # Log(cycles to failure)

model = xgb.XGBRegressor(
    n_estimators=500,
    max_depth=6,
    learning_rate=0.05,
    subsample=0.8
)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict with uncertainty (using quantile regression)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
                </div>

                <h4>2. Neural Networks for Complex Patterns</h4>
                <p>Deep neural networks can capture highly non-linear relationships and are particularly effective when combined with physics-informed constraints:</p>

                <div class="code-example">
# Physics-Informed Neural Network for Fatigue
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class FatigueNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.2),
            nn.Linear(128, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, 32),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(32, 1)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        # Output: log(N) - ensures positive cycle predictions
        return self.network(x)

    def physics_loss(self, stress, pred_cycles):
        # Enforce: higher stress → fewer cycles
        stress_gradient = torch.autograd.grad(
            pred_cycles, stress,
            grad_outputs=torch.ones_like(pred_cycles),
            create_graph=True
        )[0]
        # Penalize positive gradients (physics violation)
        return torch.relu(stress_gradient).mean()
                </div>

                <h4>3. Recurrent Networks for Loading History</h4>
                <p>LSTM networks can capture sequence-dependent damage accumulation—something Miner's rule fundamentally cannot do:</p>

                <div class="key-insight">
                    <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Research shows that high-low loading sequences cause more damage than low-high sequences at the same stress levels. LSTMs can learn these sequence effects directly from data, eliminating the need for sequence correction factors.

            <section>
                <h2>Validation and Industry Acceptance</h2>

                <p>For ML-based fatigue predictions to be accepted in safety-critical applications, rigorous validation is essential:</p>

                <h3>Validation Framework</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Analytical Benchmarks:</strong> Verify model recovers traditional S-N behavior under standard conditions</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-Validation:</strong> K-fold validation with stratified sampling by failure mode</li>
                    <li><strong>Out-of-Distribution Testing:</strong> Test on conditions not seen during training</li>
                    <li><strong>Physical Consistency:</strong> Verify predictions respect known physical constraints</li>
                    <li><strong>Comparison with Failures:</strong> Validate against documented failure cases</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Industry Standards Compliance</h3>
                <p>ML models for fatigue can be integrated with existing standards:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>DNV-RP-C203:</strong> Use ML predictions as input to standard fatigue assessment procedures</li>
                    <li><strong>API 579:</strong> ML-enhanced fitness-for-service evaluations</li>
                    <li><strong>BS 7910:</strong> Probabilistic fatigue assessment with ML-derived distributions</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Regulatory Path:</strong> Rather than replacing code-based methods, ML predictions can be used to reduce conservatism where justified by data. The base safety factor remains, but additional penalties for uncertainty can be reduced when ML models demonstrate high confidence.

            <section>
                <h2>The Future of Fatigue Assessment</h2>

                <p>Machine learning is not just improving fatigue prediction—it's enabling entirely new approaches:</p>

                <h3>Digital Twins for Fatigue Monitoring</h3>
                <p>Real-time ML models integrated with sensor data can provide continuous fatigue damage estimation, enabling true predictive maintenance.</p>

                <h3>Transfer Learning Across Assets</h3>
                <p>Models trained on one fleet can be adapted to new assets with limited data, accelerating deployment across organizations.</p>

                <h3>Physics-Informed Machine Learning</h3>
                <p>Combining ML flexibility with physics constraints ensures predictions remain physically meaningful even in extrapolation.</p>

                <div class="key-insight">
                    <strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> The convergence of sensor technology, cloud computing, and machine learning is creating opportunities for fatigue management that were impossible just a decade ago. Organizations that embrace these methods will have significant advantages in asset reliability and maintenance optimization.

            <!-- Conclusion -->
            <section>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>Machine learning offers a powerful complement to traditional fatigue assessment methods. By learning from comprehensive datasets rather than simplified laboratory tests, ML models can:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Capture complex interactions between multiple variables</li>
                    <li>Account for sequence-dependent damage accumulation</li>
                    <li>Provide probabilistic predictions with meaningful uncertainty bounds</li>
                    <li>Continuously improve as new operational data becomes available</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The key is not to replace traditional methods but to enhance them—using ML to reduce unnecessary conservatism where data supports it while maintaining the safety margins that protect lives and assets.</p>

                <p>For organizations managing fatigue-critical structures, the question is no longer whether to adopt ML-based methods, but how quickly they can build the data infrastructure and technical capabilities to do so effectively.</p>
