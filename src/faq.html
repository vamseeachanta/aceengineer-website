        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <div style="margin-top: 30px;">
            <p><b>How does A&amp;CE deliver 60-80% time savings?</b></p>
            <p>We replace manual, repetitive engineering workflows with automated pipelines. For example, a 50-configuration OrcaFlex sensitivity study that takes 100 engineer-hours manually runs overnight through our batch automation&mdash;delivering validated results by morning. The savings come from eliminating manual model setup, results extraction, and report compilation.</p>

            <p><b>What standards do you support?</b></p>
            <p>Our modules codify 17 international standards including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> DNV-RP-C203, API RP 2A, BS 7608, ABS, Norsok</li>
                <li><strong>Riser/Pipeline:</strong> API RP 2RD, API STD 2RD, DNV-OS-F201</li>
                <li><strong>Offshore Wind:</strong> IEC 61400-3, DNV-ST-0126</li>
                <li><strong>Pressure Vessels:</strong> ASME B31.8, API 579</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All 221 S-N curves are validated against published standard values with automated regression testing.</p>

            <p><b>What software tools do you integrate with?</b></p>
            <p>Our primary integrations are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>OrcaFlex:</strong> Full Python API integration for batch model generation, simulation, and post-processing</li>
                <li><strong>AQWA:</strong> Hydrodynamic model generation, RAO processing, and operability analysis</li>
                <li><strong>NASTRAN/ANSYS:</strong> FEA post-processing automation and report generation</li>
                <li><strong>Python/Polars:</strong> High-performance data processing for large engineering datasets</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>What are the typical engagement models?</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Per-project:</strong> Fixed-price deliverables (e.g., $15K for 50-configuration riser study)</li>
                <li><strong>Annual retainer:</strong> $120K/year for unlimited automation runs and priority support</li>
                <li><strong>Custom development:</strong> Time and materials for bespoke automation pipelines</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>How is intellectual property handled?</b></p>
            <p>Data is completely abstracted from the computational methods. Client-specific configurations and results remain confidential. Where practical and not constrained by IP, our core engineering libraries are open-source for transparency and validation. Client-specific automation scripts are delivered via private repositories.</p>

            <p><b>What engineering quality practices do you follow?</b></p>
            <p>All code follows production software engineering standards:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Test-Driven Development (TDD) with comprehensive unit and integration tests</li>
                <li>Version-controlled, documented, and peer-reviewed code</li>
                <li>Full traceability from input parameters to final results</li>
                <li>Automated regression testing against published standard values</li>
            </ul>
