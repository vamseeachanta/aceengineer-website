            <b> Governing Law and Venue; Injunctive Relief </b>
            <p align="justify"> This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to any principles of conflicts of law. You agree that any legal action arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in Houston, TX, that you irrevocably consent and submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of those courts for the purpose of litigating any such action; and that you will irrevocably waive any jurisdictional, venue or inconvenient forum objections to such court. The failure of AceEngineer to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that due to the unique nature of AceEngineer’s Intellectual Property, there may be no adequate remedy at law for your breach of this Agreement, and that such breach is likely to cause AceEngineer irreparable harm.  Therefore, AceEngineer shall be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction in addition to damages or other remedies it might have hereunder, at law or in equity.
